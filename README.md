# Wave Function Collapse
---

I wrote my own implementation of WFC in java.
You can provide your own tilemap under `res/tiles/<name>.png`, but add `res/tiles/<name>.configuration`, specified as
`format.txt`

## KeyBindings
 - `D` toggle debug
 - `F` toggle inspect focus
 - `B`/`N` back/next tile in focus mode
 - `space` collapse next block
